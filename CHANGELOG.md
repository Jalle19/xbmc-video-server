Changelog
=================

This file tracks the changes to the application over time. If for some reason 
you need to use an older version than the current one you can do so by checking 
out that specific tag (e.g. `git checkout 1.4.3`). To later switch to the latest 
version, run `git checkout master && git pull`. Beware that switching to a 
previous version from a newer one may break something since the project dependencies 
change over time.

#### 1.6.10
* include the address when logging login attempts
* update icons in the watch modal dialog
* enable the "Watch in browser" button for H.264/AAC/MKV files too since they work in Chrome
* added missing logging when the "Watch in browser" button is clicked

#### 1.6.9
* show a friendlier error message when "Update library" is clicked and the backend is unconnectable
* log the full request body when an API call produces an error. This makes debugging easier.
* add ability to play compatible files directly in the browser
* performance improvements, especially on the movie browse page
* fixed incorrect URL in the backend form

#### 1.6.8
* enable database schema caching by default. It is cleared automatically when applying migrations that change it.
* load Google Fonts over HTTPS if the site itself is accessed over HTTPS (fixes mixed content warnings in the browser)
* added missing line breaks when formatting logged exceptions
* log error data when a JSON-RPC error occurs
* made the "application name" setting optional. This means nothing is rendered above the main menu if both application name and subtitle are left empty.
* the "Cast" section is no longer rendered if there is no cast information available (happens on foreign TV shows and obscure movies)
* the actor grid is now rendered the same for both movies and TV shows, i.e. clicking an actor thumbnail on a TV show page will show what movies said actor is in.
* make the layout adapt better to larger screens. Now the page gets wider and wider (up to 1920x1080) instead of staying fixed at 1170 pixels maximum.

#### 1.6.7.2
* added missing French translations

#### 1.6.7.1
* only allow administrators to play media on the backend

#### 1.6.7
* show watch/download options in a modal dialog instead

#### 1.6.6
* fix adding and using backends using an IPv6 address
* fixed a bug where normal users couldn't wake a sleeping backend using WOL

#### 1.6.2
* fixed the page title on the Login page
* added missing French translation on the Settings page
* added option to customize or remove the application subtitle

* lots of various code improvements

#### 1.6.0
* upgrade the icons to use Font Awesome 4.1, and drop Fontastic
* fix the viewport scaling on mobile devices, now it should switch to showing 
thumbnails in grid view mode when the phone is tilted
* use the same default display mode regardless of device now that grid view 
works better on phones

session or browser to browser
